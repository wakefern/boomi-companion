## Installation

### Add the Marketplace

In Claude Code, use the `/plugin` command to add this marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add OfficialBoomi/boomi-companion
```

This registers the marketplace so Claude Code can discover all available Boomi plugins. The marketplace can also be managed through the VS Code extension by typing `/plugins` in the prompt box and selecting the **Marketplaces** tab.  After registering the markplace, you will be able to browse available plugins and install them.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot supports this registry as an agent-plugin marketplace. In VS Code,
ensure agent plugins are enabled for your organization, then add the marketplace to
your **user** `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "chat.plugins.marketplaces": [
    "OfficialBoomi/boomi-companion"
  ]
}
```

Open the Extensions view, filter by `@agentPlugins`, and install the Boomi plugin
you need. The marketplace makes plugins discoverable; each plugin's source
repository must also provide Copilot-compatible plugin content before it can be
installed and used.

The following underlying skills are also available as standalone packages for use with other AI agents, or to fork and modify for your own needs.
